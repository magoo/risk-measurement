The exploitation of this vulnerability is simple but not typical.</p><p>Exploitation was in the wild before I could get an <em><a href=https://magoo.medium.com/forecasting-bluekeep-5c25a8d5d681>in the wild</a></em> forecast together. The next most interesting thing was <a href=https://twitter.com/Laughing_Mantis/status/1470165580736987137>speculation</a> about whether this vulnerability would appear as a worm, which I gathered some folks up to take on with a panel forecast.</p><p>A meaningful forecast about a &ldquo;worm&rdquo; was complicated to pin down. Regardless, the process of getting the measurement together was helpful. It always seems to be! But future worm forecasting needs to be improved.</p><p>First, I&rsquo;ll describe what scenario we landed on and the measurement process. There are many areas for improvement, which I hope I can highlight with blog posts.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the scenario we picked:</p><blockquote><p>Will evidence of a worm spreading in the wild using CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) for any stage of exploitation be found within 90 days?</p></blockquote><p><figure class=figure><img class="figure-img img-fluid lazyload blur-up" data-sizes=auto src=https://magoo.github.io/simple-risk/blog/forecasting-log4j-worms/log4j-data_hu40f4c98d8a3b71d1c4f8262f147fa2f8_418506_20x0_resize_box_3.png data-srcset="https://magoo.github.io/simple-risk/blog/forecasting-log4j-worms/log4j-data_hu40f4c98d8a3b71d1c4f8262f147fa2f8_418506_900x0_resize_box_3.png 900w,https://magoo.github.io/simple-risk/blog/forecasting-log4j-worms/log4j-data_hu40f4c98d8a3b71d1c4f8262f147fa2f8_418506_800x0_resize_box_3.png 800w,https://magoo.github.io/simple-risk/blog/forecasting-log4j-worms/log4j-data_hu40f4c98d8a3b71d1c4f8262f147fa2f8_418506_700x0_resize_box_3.png 700w,https://magoo.github.io/simple-risk/blog/forecasting-log4j-worms/log4j-data_hu40f4c98d8a3b71d1c4f8262f147fa2f8_418506_600x0_resize_box_3.png 600w,https://magoo.github.io/simple-risk/blog/forecasting-log4j-worms/log4j-data_hu40f4c98d8a3b71d1c4f8262f147fa2f8_418506_500x0_resize_box_3.png 500w" width=2254 height=1366 alt=log4j-data><noscript><img class="figure-img img-fluid" sizes=100vw srcset="https://magoo.github.io/simple-risk/blog/forecasting-log4j-worms/log4j-data_hu40f4c98d8a3b71d1c4f8262f147fa2f8_418506_900x0_resize_box_3.png 900w,https://magoo.github.io/simple-risk/blog/forecasting-log4j-worms/log4j-data_hu40f4c98d8a3b71d1c4f8262f147fa2f8_418506_800x0_resize_box_3.png 800w,https://magoo.github.io/simple-risk/blog/forecasting-log4j-worms/log4j-data_hu40f4c98d8a3b71d1c4f8262f147fa2f8_418506_700x0_resize_box_3.png 700w,https://magoo.github.io/simple-risk/blog/forecasting-log4j-worms/log4j-data_hu40f4c98d8a3b71d1c4f8262f147fa2f8_418506_600x0_resize_box_3.png 600w,https://magoo.github.io/simple-risk/blog/forecasting-log4j-worms/log4j-data_hu40f4c98d8a3b71d1c4f8262f147fa2f8_418506_500x0_resize_box_3.png 500w" src=https://magoo.github.io/simple-risk/blog/forecasting-log4j-worms/log4j-data.png width=2254 height=1366 alt=log4j-data></noscript></figure></p><p>We measured this with an <a href=/simple-risk/docs/estimation/expert-elicitation>expert elicitation</a> approach, including twelve participants, and landed on a <code>65.58%</code> of occurrence. All are professionals in the security community with varying malware experience - some significant and some minor. Many of the participants were also busy with log4j response. They put their forecast in when coming up for air.</p><p>As usual, the debate (the actual goal) was helpful for all of us. Let&rsquo;s talk a bit about the forecast process.</p><p>First, worms can use multiple means of exploitation. So we needed to be clear. Are we looking for a &ldquo;full&rdquo; worm that solely used CVE-2021-44228 to get around from victim to victim?</p><p>Further, what if a worm solely uses this CVE for lateral movement within a network, and not initial exploitation?</p><p>Effective worms have historically used a handful of vulnerabilities to make themselves more widespread. But, some vulnerabilities allow for &ldquo;full&rdquo; worms that can roll off of a single vulnerability, penetrating networks and moving within them. So, is an existing worm that uses log4j in a minor role a &ldquo;log4j worm&rdquo;? We went for an inclusive approach to make a judgment (ultimately my role) easier.</p><p>Second, this vulnerability typically needs a malicious <code>ldap://</code> server, at least with the knowledge we had at the time of the forecast. Would a worm have to set up attack infrastructure with victims or have dedicated malicious servers? This impacts whether a worm is fully &ldquo;autonomous&rdquo; but might still propagate quickly. Again, we decided to be inclusive of SPOF <code>ldap://</code> attack hosts. This allowed dedicated attack hosts to be involved with the attack. You might see a trend in the forecast development by now. We&rsquo;ll cover it later.</p><p>Third, would a white-hat worm trigger this scenario? Yes, we decided not to be the judge if something is white or black hat and allowed it.</p><p>Lastly, would this have to be a brand new worm, or could this be added as a propagation method to an existing botnet? For instance, Mirai? Again, we decided on inclusivity.</p><p>All of these decisions to be inclusive of qualities of a &ldquo;worm&rdquo; all inherently add to the belief that &ldquo;yes, evidence of a worm will appear.&rdquo; So, we ended up with a probable forecast at <code>65.5%</code>.</p><p>These exceptions show the need for improved demarcation on what a &ldquo;worm&rdquo; is for future forecasting.</p><p>A takeaway: We are less interested in &ldquo;Will a worm appear?&rdquo;. Rather, we are interested in the size and impact a worm could have.</p><p>What could have been more useful:</p><ul><li>Exceeding victim thresholds from credible sources</li><li>Discovery of a &ldquo;full&rdquo; worm</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;ve drafted <a href=https://github.com/magoo/forecast-documentation/blob/master/IN-THE-WILD.md#an-in-the-wild-worm>some language</a> that might be useful in the future for worm forecasting, and I&rsquo;m happy to hear feedback that pokes holes in it. The details are in there, but it separates a &ldquo;full&rdquo; worm with a &ldquo;partial&rdquo; worm.</p><p>A full worm is &ldquo;pure&rdquo;: it shouldn&rsquo;t be reliant on any external infrastructure and be fully autonomous with discovery and exploitation. A partial worm can still exhibit some of these qualities and be something to be feared, but the definition starts to slip for forecasting purposes.</p><p>A weird exception would be the kill switch domain in WannaCry, which would have been an external dependency that would technically force it into &ldquo;partial&rdquo; worm status. I&rsquo;m unsure how to mitigate the language that excludes it from being a &ldquo;full&rdquo; worm, but I think it may have been a full worm without that kill switch. Later versions without the kill switch may have met the &ldquo;full&rdquo; definition.</p><p>In any case, figuring out the language around &ldquo;is it a worm&rdquo; helps get us to more valuable information about victimization and impact. Hopefully, we can skip right to those forecasts if a future worm should appear.</p><p>If other known standards around &ldquo;worm&rdquo; language exist that would be useful in forecasting, please reach out.</p><p>Lastly I&rsquo;ll conclude that <em>even allowing this inclusive definition of a worm</em>, I imagine most vulnerabilities would not measure as CVE-2021-44228 has, as most vulnerabilities are not wrapped up into active worms. So, this measurement would still be informative to me and have me take a second look at the vulnerability, assuming this measurement was all I had.</p></article></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer text-muted"><div class=container-xxl><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 order-last order-lg-first"><ul class=list-inline><li class=list-inline-item>Send feedback to <a href=https://www.twitter.com/magoo>@magoo</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-lg-8 order-first order-lg-last text-lg-end"><ul class=list-inline></ul></div></div></div></footer><script src=/simple-risk/js/bootstrap.min.592b9faf6c83a2bda564a377cf82f9a67546b198510a93fdb0728f9622ec22729d44be02fb2ea16c3fe5365ae1806259cd111932ca28e68b66462d6937635bab.js integrity="sha512-WSufr2yDor2lZKN3z4L5pnVGsZhRCpP9sHKPliLsInKdRL4C+y6hbD/lNlrhgGJZzREZMsoo5otmRi1pN2Nbqw==" crossorigin=anonymous defer></script>
