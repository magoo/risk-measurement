We may be left to use data with only a loose relationship with the target problem, or nothing at all.\nThe response to these situations may be to trust experts who have developed the most intuition around these risks and elicit numerical values from them. They may adjust reference class data, or provide a best estimate through a structured approach.\nThe elicitation of numerical values from experts has many known approaches. These values can be used for all sorts of risk measurement, and the approaches increase in structure depending on the need for rigor.\nRigor # Watercooler estimations are encouraged. Casual discussions can help build culture around estimation skill. Structured elicitation can increasingly include the following techniques to support high impact decision making or dangerous risks.\n First, the reduction of bias is common in elicitation methods. Elicitation is a human, subjective process that can be guarded against harmful influence. A panel of experts can have values combined to better represent a consensus view and eliminate bias from a single individual. Questions and feedback is structured to promote learning before concluding. The debate between experts is often managed closely to protect participants from unhealthy influence. Experts are trained for probabilistic calibration and forecasting skill. Data is carefully introduced as a reference class, or monte carlo simulations are developed to support judgement. Forecasting platforms like the Good Judgement Open are examples of elicitation at scale.  As you may imagine, Elicitation that incorporates all of these factors would be time consuming, resource heavy, and expensive to organize.\nSimple Elicitation # A simple, workplace approach to expert elicitation looks as follows:\n Clearly define the desired values or distribution. Train expert(s) for elicitation. Elicit a preliminary value from experts. If time allows, encourage discussion between experts (if any) If time allows, elicit a final value.  Other methods # These are formal methods that look to preserve scientific integrity or assist with defensible policy making. They are procedurally \u0026ldquo;heavy\u0026rdquo;.\n Delphi (paper) is used by RAND and has a colorful history in many industries. Is known for heavily protecting participants and structuring Q\u0026amp;A between elicitations. Cooke\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;classical\u0026rdquo; method is well known in environmental sciences and is used for applying stronger weighting to experts who perform better in calibration exercises. The SHELF method has visible usage and journal references but is not yet understood by this documentation\u0026rsquo;s authors.

(link)\n Error # Probabilistic statements are uncertain and produce error. All probabilistic statements that are not certain (A full 100% or 0%) result in error. The risks we measure will hopefully have observable outcomes, and we can apply truth to these statements and calculate error, or a score.\nScore (or \u0026ldquo;error\u0026rdquo;): The accuracy of an individual forecast when compared to hindsight.\nChicken Little 🐤 is an example of a low scoring forecast. Chicken Little says that the sky is absolutely going to fall, and then the sky does not fall. The forecast is incorrect and is scored poorly. Chiken Little is a demonstrably poor source of information.\nCalibration: How trustworthy the source of a forecast is.\nThe Boy Who Cried Wolf 🐺 is an example of poor calibration. Repeated, high confidence claims that turn out to be false will result in poor calibration and would attract correction. A poorly calibrated individual may frequently use the phrase \u0026quot;I'm 90% sure\u0026quot; and end up being correct a mere 10% of the time.\nDecades of research show that humans are poorly calibrated without training, practice, or corrective feedback loops. (See: Meehl, Tetlock and Kent).\nResearch shows that individuals are calibrated with minimal training, and regular practice supports this as well. (See: Tetlock. Good Judgement)\nKeeping Score # Forecasts that include their associated confidence can make use of the Brier Score to record accuracy over time. This is simply calculated as the \u0026quot;Squared Error\u0026quot;.\nThe Good Judgement Open has an accessible definition of the Brier Score: :\nThe Brier score is the squared error of a probabilistic forecast. To calculate it, we divide your forecast by 100 so that your probabilities range between 0 (0%) and 1 (100%). Then, we code reality as either 0 (if the event did not happen) or 1 (if the event did happen). For each answer option, we take the difference between your forecast and the correct answer, square the differences, and add them all together. For a yes/no question where you forecasted 70% and the event happened, your score would be (1 – 0.7)2 + (0 – 0.3)2 = 0.18. For a question with three possible outcomes (A, B, C) where you forecasted A = 60%, B = 10%, C = 30% and A occurred, your score would be (1 – 0.6)2 + (0 – 0.1)2 + (0 – 0.3)2 = 0.26. The best (lowest) possible Brier score is 0, and the worst (highest) possible Brier score is 2. An average Brier score is useful for tracking the reliability of a forecaster. It can be tracked by certain topics, panels, individuals, etc.\nFor instance, let's take a batch of some pretty good weather predictions.\n   Forecast % Rain % No Rain Outcome Brier Score Brier Score (Work)     1 0.99 0.01 Yes (1) 0.0002 (1-.99)^2+(0-.01)^2   2 0.8 0.2 Yes (1) 0.08 (1-.8)^2+(0-.2)^2   3 0.334 0.666 No (0) 0.223112 (0-.334)^2 + (1-.666)^2   4 0.01 0.99 No (0) 0.0002 (0-.01)^2 + (1-.99)^2   5 0.95 0.05 Yes (1) 0.005 (1-.95)^2 + (0-.05)^2    This table shows an average Brier Score of 0.0617024. If we observed this forecast score from our local meteorologist, we'd be pleased and consider this forecast source useful. Let's put together a table of pretty terrible weather forecasts for comparison.\n   Forecast % Rain % No Rain Outcome Brier Score Brier Score (Work)     1 0.1 0.9 Yes (1) 1.62 1(1-.01)\\^2+(0-.9)^2   2 0.04 0.96 Yes (1) 1.8432 (1-.04)^2+(0-.96)^2   3 0.77 0.23 No (0) 1.1858 (0-.77)^2+(1-.23)^2   4 0.88 0.12 No (0) 1.5488 (0-.88)^2+(1-.12)^2   5 0.2 0.8 Yes (1) 1.28 (1-.2)\\^2+(0-.8)\\^2    This table shows an average brier score of 1.49556. Any reasonable individual would consider those forecasts not useful.\nYour industry will vary on what a \u0026quot;useful\u0026quot; threshold for a forecast source would be. For instance, a Brier Score that forecasts data related to part failures and explosions will be very different from a risk forecast about missed project deadlines. This documentation leaves that up to the engineers involved to set their requirements.\nHowever, all industries can agree that engineers seeing a reduction of a Brier Score over time is a favorable trend.\nForecast sources can also be compared with the \u0026quot;Brier Skill Score\u0026quot;, in which we can discover better risk prediction models or methods. This is heavily used in meteorology to compare the value of a predictive model to a tried and true model, like a simple historical average. It is expressed simply with two Brier scores being compared below.\n BrierSkillScore = 1.0 – BrierScoreNew / BrierScoreReference\n Calibration # Calibration is best observed with a line chart. We graph a lot of forecasts with their average correctness, in buckets of certainty. We can then make statements like:\n \u0026ldquo;When we\u0026rsquo;re 90% sure of a future event, we\u0026rsquo;re correct 90% of the time.\u0026rdquo;\n This chart shows that the source of forecasts (a person, a statistical model) is perfectly calibrated. When they are 10% confident, they are historically 10% correct. When they are 0% or 100% certain of an event, it will absolutely shake out that way with no mistakes.\n  A perfectly calibrated source of forecasts could be seriously valuable. The source\u0026rsquo;s suggestions would come with great authority (especially with bold forecasts at 0% or 100%). This is not common in low information situations (like risk) and especially when dealing with human forecasts.\nThe following chart demonstrates an unreliable source of forecasts. The chart communicates to us that we can\u0026rsquo;t trust the judgement of the source of forecasts. The source may claim some percentage of certainty towards an outcome while their track record doesn\u0026rsquo;t support it.\n  A more realistic and well calibrated source may have some error, but not significant, like the following:\n  This sort of calibration is what you might find from human sources who have been trained and have been corrected over time by calibrated themselves.\nVolume required for calibration # Calibration can be difficult to analyze without a large volume of forecasts. Forecasts with 50% certainty can be assessed quickly, while forecasts with 99% certainty may require hundred(s) of forecasts to properly detect if they are truly have one-in-one-hundred errors or not.\nIf calibration is an important value in your risk assessment methodology, you can standardize a lower level of certainty (say, 70%) to increase the ability to audit calibration.\n"}).add({id:3,href:"/simple-risk-config-toml/docs/estimation/percentiles/",title:"Percentiles",description:"A percentile estimate is a probability and value pulled from a distribution.

The median (50% percentile) customer account value is $1K. 75% of our incidents last under 3 days to investigate.  Elicitation is quick and often understood. Though, a sole percentile estimate won\u0026rsquo;t disclose other information about a risk (extreme values or underlying distributions).\nFor instance, let\u0026rsquo;s say the 90% height in a group of people happens to be 6 foot 3. Knowing that height is normally distributed, we don\u0026rsquo;t expect the remaining 10% of people to include any 20 foot giants. Rather, we expect the remaining 10% of people to be able to walk through a doorway.\nHowever, a 90% percentile estimate of regualtory settlements may be entirely different. Assume 90% of settlements are expected to be under $200 million for a business. Within that remaining 10% of possible settlements may be some extreme values in the multiple billions.\nThe percentile itself does not communicate distributions of risk.

It is generally assumed in this documentation that the interval is symmetric and represents the middle of the distribution you\u0026rsquo;re discussing.\nMore on Intervals # A credible interval represents a range of possible values, and also includes a percentage belief (confidence) that the outcome will fall into it.\nIn studying risk: Increased research, data, or effort could change the interval in a couple ways.\n The size of the interval may change: This means the possible outcomes become greater. For example, there may be a 90% chance that 10-20 employee laptops are unencrypted. After some research, this may shrink to a 90% chance that 1-10 employee laptops are unencrypted. The probability of the interval: This means that the odds become more or less likely that possible outcomes occur. For instance, a 90% chance of settlement costs between $10M-$100M dollars might reduce to 80% after some effort.  Here\u0026rsquo;s a longer form example. A investigation is about to conclude. The investigator might need to terminate an unusual amount of employees very quickly. The investigator is worried about resources to support the effort and wants to provide a measurement for human resources and physical security to anticipate their needs.\nHere is a scenario they propose:\n Scenario : Number of employees fired after conclusion of investigation.  An interval estimate could read as A 95% chance of 0-5 terminations.

It\u0026rsquo;s a feature of our CI/CD system, and is effectively a remotely accessible shell running as root.\nThere are complicating factors:\n Several partners companies remotely access build001 The script console that offers a shell to the host is used regularly.

Let\u0026rsquo;s do that now.\nPrevious work has already measured the vulnerability as-is with at having a 60% chance of being involved in a disclosable incident. (see the Vulnerability example)\nAfter a bunch of brainstorming, let\u0026rsquo;s say we come up with the following goal:\n📉  Reduce the probability of a disclosable incident to 5% or lower within the next 30 days.  This number was arrived at based on the opinion of yourself, or your group, that some method exists to hit this target. Now we just have to make those plans.\nThe plans # Our quant efforts don\u0026rsquo;t spit out plans, we do. We\u0026rsquo;ve set these goalposts for ourselves, but we still require an achievable plan to get there. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume the following plan is suggested by the team:\n Bring build001 down for maintenance and investigation. Create a network ACL limited to partner access. Reduce authorization in credentials on build001, bring back online. Prioritize the migration off of build001 and onto build002  This fix doesn\u0026rsquo;t totally eliminate the vulnerability! As written, it\u0026rsquo;s better described as a workaround.

An investigation has an 80% (No Change) chance of finding build001 compromised.  Let\u0026rsquo;s talk through these changes.\nRegardless of how they came upon these numbers: The team is expressing confidence that exploitation is less likely with network ACL\u0026rsquo;s (going from 45% to 5%)\nNext, A disclosure event seems less likely with the reduced credential footprint, (but not eliminated!), so the reduced forecast 60% to 30% is reasonable to see a reduction there.\nLast, there is no change in whether it is currently compromised or not. This makes sense, since new mitigations can\u0026rsquo;t change whether it is compromised right now or not.\nThe decision # Now that the reasoning for these reductions are understood, we can make a decision on whether these risks are under our threshold. There\u0026rsquo;s now a 5% of exploitation in 30 days. If this happens, there\u0026rsquo;s a 30% chance it would result in a disclosable event. When worked out, this gives us 5% x 30% = 1.5%, or a 1.5% chance of a disclosable event which is well below the threshold we set for an acceptable decision.\nAssuming the group agrees to the approach and the work, we have back-of-napkin\u0026rsquo;d our model of the risks that matter to us and met a target we are good with.\n"}).add({id:7,href:"/simple-risk-config-toml/docs/examples/new-product-review/",title:"New Product Review",description:"Measuring risk of future products.",content:"Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine a new product.

This means our decomposition needs to be Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive (MECE in business speak).\ngraph TD; A[SEV0 \u0026gt; $10M]--\u0026gt;B[Other]; A--\u0026gt;C[Application Failure]; A--\u0026gt;D[Infrastructure Failure]; A--\u0026gt;F[IT Failure] A--\u0026gt;E[Insider]; Let\u0026rsquo;s assume we have forecasts to support this breakdown. Because we\u0026rsquo;re breaking down all possibilities for the SEV0 \u0026gt; $10M scenario, the following need to equal 100%.\n 🏆 IT Failure: 40% Application Failure: 25% Infrastructure Failure: 20% Other: 10% Insider: 5%  It looks like IT Failures make up a lot of the risk here. But why do all of this work?\nManagement-through-metrics is a focus area where troubling patterns can sometimes be found in an organization. Be careful with performance incentives based on reductions to subjective risk measurements.\nThere are many issues with strict quantitative leadership which may make it into this documentation in the future.\n Risk based knowledge work resists simple performance measurement. Knowledge workers are trusted to measure and manage themselves. OKRs and peer reviews are crucial for evaluating a knowledge worker. Objective measurement is efficient, but risk is a subjective concern. Overly quantitative management becomes subjected to Goodhart’s Law.  Rather, we are concerned about encouraging and organizing behaviors that decompose the KPI. A quantitative risk used as a KPI provides direction, and creates an organizational obligation to discover where the contributors to that risk come from.\nFor instance, a high performing engineer will demonstrate the relationship of their efforts to how their efforts in finding and mitigating risks relate to informing the KPIs.\nSimilarly, a directional risk scenario can help engineers self-organize around clearly identified risks and the causes that contribute to them. Product organizations do this similarly with directly measurable metrics (Monthly Recurring Revenue, Monthly Active Users, etc) and we\u0026rsquo;re simply doing the same with a synthetic metric.\n"}).add({id:10,href:"/simple-risk-config-toml/docs/examples/vulnerability/",title:"Vulnerability",description:"Measuring a vulnerability's risk",content:"You\u0026rsquo;ve found a bug. We\u0026rsquo;ll provide an example bug. Forget any previous vulnerability risk framework you\u0026rsquo;ve learned over the years, including color coding, zero-to-ten scales, or high/medium/low. We\u0026rsquo;re going to think about the bug critically and communicate the nuances that distinguish this bug from other bugs.\n Example: We\u0026rsquo;ve found an internet exposed Jenkins server (build001) with the scripting console accessible.\n Probably familiar to you. A very common vulnerability many of us have run into. Our build environment is a Jenkins is a CI/CD server that companies use to continuously build software. The scripting console is basically a web based shell available to an attacker, giving remote code execution.\nSounds like a critical finding. Right? Under normal circumstances this is a \u0026ldquo;just fix it\u0026rdquo; vulnerability that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t require a whole lot of debate to prioritize. Or\u0026hellip; so you\u0026rsquo;d think.\nWe register the vulnerability in build001 as VULN-0 in some fancy task management sytem or tracker.\nHistorically, you might write label the bug as critical, Unbreak Now!, CVSS 10, P0, or other terms I\u0026rsquo;d like you to forget for now. Despite these scary sounding labels:\n Another team might need to be tapped to investigate and fix it. This other team might not share your sense of urgency. There may be other pressing tasks (or vulnerabilities) being mitigated. Your team (and others) may be swimming in critical bugs. Other teams disagree about criticality.  Now there\u0026rsquo;s a need to step into this vulnerability and communicate it more specifically. With analysis, we will tease out and communicate the intricacies of this vulnerability that are causing us, as experts, to find this vulnerability undesireable.\nFirst, this bug is internet facing. Literally anyone can find this vulnerabilty. Plus, there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of tooling available to find it efficiently. So, we want to communicate the simplicity of which this can be found. Exploitation is also simple - it\u0026rsquo;s literally designed to be used as scriptable access to the underlying system.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s think of this in terms of time to exploitation and we can model a scenario as needed to communicate it. What are the odds this will be exploited within 30 days? The timeframe is arbitrary and we can pick any term. We\u0026rsquo;re looking to communicate a short term urgency. So, maybe we choose something like 30 days.\nNow we have a scenario and can forecast against it properly as we have learned. Let\u0026rsquo;s say the forecast comes in at 45%.\n Scenario: A SEV0 involving VULN-0 exploitation occuring within 30 days.\nForecast: 45% Yes\n  Second, the server is a build system that might be a dumpsterfire of ACL exceptions, credentials, intellectual property (source code). The compromise of the host itself is not a disclosable incident. Notably, user data is just a stone\u0026rsquo;s throw away. Lateral movement towards protected data would be trivial for an attacker.\nWe will create a new forecast, preceded with a condition that an adversary has already exploited this vulnerability on build001. There\u0026rsquo;s nuance to possible outcomes:\nAn adversary might not be entirely concerned about your data - especially one that discovers this vulnerability from broad scanning. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;ll install a cryptominer and move on\u0026hellip; or not. So, this is probabilistic as well. Since we\u0026rsquo;re working with examples, we\u0026rsquo;ll suggest the forecast comes in at 60%.\n Condition: VULN-0 was exploited and discovered.\nScenario: Incident response will require disclosure.\nForecast: 60%\n  Lastly, and most concerning\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s probably compromised already! It\u0026rsquo;s vulnerable now, not in the future. Let\u0026rsquo;s pretend that this vulnerability has existed for a year or more. Yikes! We will still create a scenario for a current state, so long as it\u0026rsquo;s not yet confirmed.\n Scenario: An investigation will reveal that build001 is compromised.\nForecast: 80%.\n  Now we have three forecasts, summarized here for readability.\n Vulnerability: VULN-0\nDescription: Our build host build001 has a globally accessible shell scripting console.\nScenario: We believe VULN-0 will be exploited within 30 days.\nForecast: 45%\nCondition: VULN-0 was exploited. Scenario: Incident response will require disclosure.\nForecast: 60%\nScenario: An investigation will find build001 compromised.\nForecast: 80%\n  Exploitation has a 45% chance with a 60% the resulting incident would be disclosable in 30 days. This works out to a 45% x 60% = 27% chance that a disclosable incident will occur within 30 days (if it hasn\u0026rsquo;t already).\nHopefully the parties who review these measurements will be convinced about the nature of the risk involved and will help with a fix. Now, we prepare for the event that they are not fixed.\n"}).add({id:11,href:"/simple-risk-config-toml/docs/examples/vulnerability-impact/",title:"Vulnerability Impact",description:"Measuring vulnerability impact.",content:"Impact can be frustrating to work with because a variety of undesirable outcomes may or may not happen.

How frequently will the core be damaged?

Miscommunication with others is common without clarifying what you are measuring.\nSven Ove Hansson describes risk with many definitions:\n An unwanted event which may or may not occur. The cause of an unwanted event which may or may not occur. The probability of an unwanted event which may or may not occur. The statistical expectation value of an unwanted event which may or may not occur. The fact that a decision is made under conditions of known probabilities.  For example, playing russian roulette (1/8 odds) compared to walking through a literally haunted house (👻).\nThere are obviously more uses of the word risk.\n The lack of obvious mitigations (Driving without a seatbelt is a risk) An amount of property at stake (I have nothing to lose to the stock market!) General expressions of fear. (This feels pretty risky\u0026hellip;)  There are obviously consistent themes involved with all of these definitions. They all relate, somehow, to the likelihood of a future event, or the impact of a future event, or both.\nBe careful to spot different interpretations when discussing risk with others; You may think you\u0026rsquo;re talking about the same thing, when in fact, you\u0026rsquo;re talking past one another.\nMath # Traditional risk is represented as the following\nr = p * i The equation can be described as a scenario.\n r is Risk, or sometimes described as the Expected Value. p is a Probability involved with the scenario. i is an Impact.  Quantitative risk is composed from the product of how probable an undesireable event is, and the probable impacts that would result.\nWe very often focus on smaller components of this equation. Practical cybersecurity blue team work is full of examples where we make assumptions about a scenario or impact. \u0026ldquo;Assume Breach\u0026rdquo; is one of them, which you\u0026rsquo;ve likely heard of. Sometimes we assume a breach has already occurred, and work to mitigate downstream impact. Then, we may switch gears and patch a vulnerability that could cause that same breach to begin with.\nThis leaves us finding ourselves applying many hours understanding the probability of a scenario of an occurring\u0026hellip; while we make assumptions about impact. Or vice versa. This is why understanding the whole equation is necessary for understanding how everyone contributes to the reduction of risk.\nHowever, actual risk measurement work can be creative and flexible depending on our areas of interest.\nExpected Value # Let\u0026rsquo;s say our scenario states how much risk a museum\u0026rsquo;s assets ($500M) a museum has to a fire (1% odds) next year.\nrisk = $500M * 1%\nThe expected value (r) of losses would be $1M. If this scenario were simulated hundreds of thousands of times\u0026hellip; the average loss would also be about $1M\u0026hellip; the same value we would expect. So, the name \u0026ldquo;expected value\u0026rdquo; is quite helpfully chosen!\nThe expected value is useful in comparison with the expected value of other risks. You can compare the expected value of risks and prioritize them.\nAlso, mitigation costs can also be explored in comparison to the reduction of expected value. If a mitigation is more expensive than the reduction of a risk - it may not worth mitigating.\nExplained similarly: The expected value of coming up heads on a coin flip is 50%, which can either be calculated or simulated.\nProbability # The probability (p) of an event could come from a variety of places. Let\u0026rsquo;s use an example scenario of a fire taking place at a chosen museum next year.\nWhere would we gather a probability of this happening for use in analysis? The answer takes some creativity and some resourcefulness. There may be statistical data on fires at museums you could manually collect. Maybe the insurance company provides their estimate based on claims data. Perhaps risk managing employees at the museum perfomed a study and were elicited for a probability.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll notice from these examples that probability is subjective! Even if we were to statistically calculate a likelihood from a useful dataset, it would still be up to us (the subject) to choose this indirect measurement as representative of a future probability. Accepting this data allows this data to suggest furture performance, when we already know that past results do not guarantee future performance.\nProbability used this way is considered a measure of evidence or belief, rather than a certification of future outcomes.\nProbabilities must follow the probability axioms. You\u0026rsquo;ll find more formal definitions elsewhere, but they\u0026rsquo;re explained here for context in risk modeling.\nFirst axiom: A probability has to be a non-negative real number.\n It\u0026rsquo;s not possible to be infinity percent sure of something, right? Similarly, you can\u0026rsquo;t be -5% sure, either.  Second axiom: All of the events in the sampled space must equal 1.\n Assume we\u0026rsquo;re predicting the winner of the Super Bowl. The combined odds of all of the candidates must equal one (100%). Since there\u0026rsquo;s two teams involved, the sum of each victory probability must equal 100%. If you\u0026rsquo;re estimating some percentage of a system being exploited, then the other half must sum to 1. 5% Yes + 95% No = 100%  So, all potential outcomes in an experiment must equal one. Or looked at the other way around: All possible outcomes must divvy up (and exhaust) the 100% odds. No leftovers!  Third axiom: For all events in a sampled space that are mutually exclusive, the result of their sum should equal their union.\nIn more simple english, imagine a deck of cards. There are no \u0026ldquo;Kings\u0026rdquo; that are \u0026ldquo;Queens\u0026rdquo;, because the face cards are mutually exclusive. No card is both a King and a Queen.\nSo, the odds of a card being a King (1 in 13) can be added to the odds of being a Queen (also, 1 in 13) safely (2 in 13 odds of being a King OR Queen)\nHowever, the odds of being a Heart and a King are not mutually exclusive, because they intersect with the King of Hearts which is simultanously both cards.\nSo, you cannot cleanly add the odds of being a King (1 in 13) with the odds of being a Heart (1 in 4), because there is a single card that could be both. 16 cards would meet the criteria of being a King or a Heart in reality. If you broke this rule and treated them as mutually exclusive, you might count the King of Hearts twice, or not at all. This is a failure of quantitative risk modeling.\n🚨  This axiom creates problems in real world risk measurement. Keep reading!  Enforcing this axiom (or ignoring it) creates weaknesses in probabilistic risk assessments. This property is something we work against in making broad risk models.\nIn cyber security: We often make models that treat events as mutually exclusive when they are not. As an example:\nWhile it is unlikely that an spearphishing APT group might work with an insider, these are not mutually exclusive events, and it\u0026rsquo;s certainly not outside the realm of possibility that it could occur.\nWe are easily suprised by what we see in the wild because it breaks our models, but our models may still be applicable as a proxy to organize efforts around them.\nHowever, we will always operate with models (quantitative or not) and cannot escape them. Quantitative modeling is clear on where they can be improved and corrected, which is where it beats qualitative methods. Qualitative methods might have benefits covering complex scenarios, but may not have the same measurement capability.\nImpact # Impact i represents losses. It could be as simple as a i = 1 to represent an all or nothing event, like death. Or, it could the value of a bank account, the passengers on a plane\u0026hellip; or from our previous example: The value of all art in a museum.\nHowever, impact is another probabilistic value with varying results. This will be covered in distributions. Here, let\u0026rsquo;s consider the behavior of some cybersecurity impacts:\n The absurd variance involved in breach costs An under-the-radar incident compared to sustained headlines in the press Prolonged civil litigation, versus a quick settlement The amount of customers that may, or may not, churn from an incident. The amount of time fixing a vulnerability.  When impact is a simple value-at-rest, like a bank account\u0026hellip; it can simply be represented by that value. When impact behaves probabilistically, we can resort to writing code as a monte carlo simulation.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s OK to assume that a scenario will take place and focus on studying its impact, just like it\u0026rsquo;s OK to assume that an incident is bad enough to warrant a study of its causes.\nRisk in practice # While r = p * i is foundational to risk measurement, it is not always the focus of our studies. We focus more practically on certain aspects of risk due to our interests or limitations. We are often surrounded by factors that shape our ability to influence a risk.\n Your time and resources available. The skillsets you can contribute to a problem. A short lived opportunity to mitigate a risk. You, or your team's role in the mitigation  As such, you might find yourself with many available strategies that have limitations associated with them. Or, you may be simply asked to use a specific strategy arbitrarily.\nHere is an example scenario:\n The vault will be robbed during overnight hours, in Q2, resulting in $1M loss or greater.  We face limitations as engineers that may hinder our ability to influence either the likelihoods or impacts that compose a risk.\nThis limits the ability of engineers to influence risk when using definitions of risk that attempt to strictly track the Expected Value of a risk, since the Expected Value requires that both factors are calculated.\n👉  The Expected Value of risk is equal to the product of its likelihood and impact. For example, a 50% likelihood of a $10 loss within a year has an expected value of $5 annually.  A fully rational approach to mitigating this risk would be to explore options that reduce the Expected Value of this risk.\nHowever, in reality, we may not be operating in a fully quantified environment. For instance, we might be the company that manufactures the walls of the vault. We don't get to know what will be stored inside of our vaults, but we do know how likely a certain type of drill would pierce the vault, given a certain amount of time.\nAlternatively, we may be in charge of customer use of the vault. Maybe this allows us to estimate the value of what is stored in the vault, but aren't tasked with understanding the likelihood of it being stolen.\nIndeed, many people involved with risk will need their own measurement tooling before Expected Value can be considered.\nThere are plenty of examples where engineers will not be calculating the full Expected Value of losses, but this does not limit their measurement opportunity to help inform this value. It's important to recognize that an engineer may be surfacing specific details for future management, and that these values are useful.\nThese sorts of measurement limitations are common in engineering. This documentation serves as guidance towards risk measurement in more practical situations so that they can be useful with broader risk management situations where expected values become useful while informing a broad picture of risk, and the decision making associated with it.\nThe world being as it is, the Expected Value of a risk is a desirable thing to measure, but it is unreasonable to think that all participants in risk mitigation will be fully concerned with it. Instead, we can trust that efforts to mitigate a risk may reduce the Expected Value of a loss, even if an engineer doesn't have the full picture measured.\nUncertainty and Risk # Uncertainty is a term that often comes up in risk measurement, and is often used interchangeably with probability. For example, the probability of some scenario occuring can be described as the uncertainty involved with that scenario.\nHowever, there are interpretations of risk that distinguish risk from uncertainty, as Knightian Uncertainty.\nThis interpretation of risk could certainly do us a favor and use different terminology. Nonetheless, the lessons drawn from this interpretation are important enough to cover for cybersecurity risk. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that very well read minds disagree with whether Knightian risk actually exists, but it is still a good model for discussing the information surrounding a scenario.\nThrough this lens, you can view a risk as something that is deeply susceptible to measurement, and uncertainty as something that is not.\nKnightian Risk\nA game of Russian roulette can be considered a Knightian risk. Your odds are right there in the chamber; A six shooter has a 5 in 6 odds of survival, and 1 in 6 odds of ruin. Also, you can inspect the gun itself for flaws. A player can perform industrial radiography on the revolver and check for manufacturing flaws, and do the same with the bullet. Similar models can be tested for jams or other malfunctions. All said, Russian roulette can be a very well understood system to a potential player. However, knowing this system does not make the odds any favorable - it is still likely to be about 1 in 6, unless new information is found. Adding more resources and science to the study of the game does not make the game any more or less safe.\nKnightian Uncertainty\nSpending the night in a literally haunted house is an example of Knightian Uncertainty. You\u0026rsquo;d be unfamiliar with the houses inner-hauntings. You\u0026rsquo;d not have about previous victims who have survived a night in the house. Perhaps you only have some evidence of a terrifying event that took place that earned its reputation.\nWhile this is a humorous example, you can tell that scientific approaches are more difficult in this scenario, not cost efficient, or not invented yet. Until the scooby-doo crew comes in and reveals the inner workings of the haunted house, A rigorously studied probability is not available to make a decision about whether to stay in a haunted house or not. Someone could, perhaps, make a forecast about a life-or-death scenario within the house, but it will likely have a lot of noise between different individuals making the forecast as there is likely no statistical anchor between them.\nKnightian application to Cyber-Security # A useful interpretation of Knightian risk for cybersecurity is to discuss how much inspection or research is available for a certain scenario. There are obviously areas of cybersecurity that are deeply covered with measurement opportunities: audits, detection, logging, red teaming and all sorts of other analysis. These can be viewed as efforts that moves risks farther on a spectrum from unknown to known, and are more abundant in networks and areas that we control, or are well resourced.\nHowever, there are risks that do not have similar opportunities. These risks are more difficult to transition into more knowable problems. For instance:\n The security of your vendors may only be understood through a questionnaire. The machinations of your adversaries intentions may never be fully known. After an acquisition, the possibility of an existing breach can\u0026rsquo;t be fully eliminated.  Even well traveled, open source, and heavily tested code can have risks, so this is not to say that either side of Knightian interpretation is preferrable. Rather, we should be sensitive to the amount of study that has occurred behind the risks we are making decisions about, and value opportunities to measure risks that are hard to reach.\nDecision making should take into account the understanding of risks that lack appropriate study, versus well studied risks. See Decision Standards for thoughts on incorporating this level of rigor into a decision.\n"}).add({id:15,href:"/simple-risk-config-toml/docs/enterprise/organizing-risks/",title:"Organizing Risks",description:"An enterprise has a lot of varying risks.

We\u0026rsquo;ll call the scenario: SEV0 with Regulatory Disclosure.\nIf we were to judge what type of incident the scenario was based on the labels above, what would be the area with the most risk?\nProbabilistic scenarios can be decomposed as a hierarchy and allow us to break down these risks into function organizations. Despite the variance in all of these disciplines, we may still be concerned with measuring the probability of a SEV0 requiring regulatory disclosure to any party.\ngraph TD; A[SEV0 with Regulatory Disclosure] A--\u0026gt;C[CorpSec]; A--\u0026gt;D[InfraSec]; A--\u0026gt;E[AppSec]; A--\u0026gt;F[ProdSec]; B[Other]; A --\u0026gt;B So, how would one of these labels be applied to a SEV0? This may be classified during an incident review, a postmortem or retrospective process, or simply a judgement by a CISO or other leader.\nThis risk model allows us to federate this risk to be studied under CorpSec by another group. CorpSec can wholly own and investigate risks with a top level \u0026ldquo;SEV0 with Regulatory Disclosure\u0026rdquo; requirement. They can ask themselves, \u0026ldquo;What could take place within CorpSec that would result in a SEV0 and a disclosure?\u0026rdquo;\nNow, this team or organization can be introspective about their own risks while contributing to the larger organization\u0026rsquo;s goals.\nThis study might look something like the following:\ngraph TD; A[CorpSec: SEV0 with Regulatory Disclosure] Z[SEV0 with Regulatory Disclosure]--\u0026gt;A; A--\u0026gt;C[Endpoint Intrusion]; A--\u0026gt;D[Insider]; A--\u0026gt;D1[Corp App ATO]; A--\u0026gt;E[Removable Storage Theft]; A--\u0026gt;F[VPN Intrusion]; B[Other]; A --\u0026gt;B Because we\u0026rsquo;re decomposing the same organizational scenario, we can study the model as a whole organization.\nNow we can quantify each CorpSec scenario as a fraction of the overall risk from CorpSec, and CorpSec as a fraction of the overall risk of a SEV0 with regulatory disclosure.\nAd-Hoc Approaches # Federated assessments suffer the same fate as any process revolving around a single metric. Eventually the model begins to lose representation of what risks an organization is concerned about.\nThe previous example revolves around regulatory disclosure. What if some teams are focused on reputation damage, customer churn, or civil liability? These concerns may not be captured in the model.\nIn these cases it makes sense to federate studies with broad organizational concerns, but these larger directional efforts should not clobber with more focused efforts to manage risk where the model does not shine.\n"}).add({id:16,href:"/simple-risk-config-toml/docs/intro/scenarios/",title:"Scenarios",description:"We use scenarios to specifically define future events and impacts that we'd like to measure.

This must happen before we start measurement, either through the collection of historic data or through expert elicitation.\nIn our discussion about risk we discussed the likelihood and impact of a future event, as r = p * i\nA point of failure in measurement is ambiguity about a risk problem being solved. A group of very smart people can spin in circles discussing a risk if they don't pin a specific outcome down first.\nUntil we define a scenario, r = p *i is not useful.\nTo do this, we explicitly define a risk with a scenario, which is an unambiguous statement about an undesireable future event.\nA scenario can have multiple outcomes to be estimated. For instance, an explosion may have costs, loss of life, or periods afterward spent offline.\nHere's a batch of examples:  Scenario : We disclose an incident to a regulator next quarter.   Scenario : Employees at a datacenter are unreachable during an incident next year.   Scenario : We are named in a lawsuit covered by a major newspaper next quarter.  Scenarios should be familiar because many industries advocate for the tabletop scenario as a way to encourage brainstorming and better understanding of risks.\nAlways include a specific timeframe. # We must include a specific timeframe with our scenarios. A risk can be viewed completely differently if it described as something happening tomorrow, or within the next ten years. Discussing scenarios without specific timeframes will cause communication and prioritization issues.\nView scenarios as a hierarchy. # A scenario has ties to the Fault Tree and Tree diagram, whereas higher level outcomes at the top of a tree aggregate the likelihoods of more specific events at the branches of a tree. Doing so keeps us compatible with quantitative risk methods, as it follows an axiom of probability.\nHere, we breakdown the methods that malicious code could have executed on an endpoint.\ngraph TD; A[Malware has executed on an endpoint] A--\u0026gt;C[A: Browser Exploit]; A--\u0026gt;D[B: User ran malicious binary]; A--\u0026gt;E[C: Hijacked App Dependency]; A--\u0026gt;F[D: Networked Service Exploit on Host] B[Other]; A --\u0026gt;B This is described as decomposing a risk. Decomposition offers flexibility in scenario building. With this flexibility, one could target broad failures, or more narrow ones, by being more or less precise with language.\nThe process of decomposing a risk with a group is sometimes the most useful part of quantitative risk exercises.\nHowever, a modeling assumption is that these decompositions are mutually exclusive and are not in violation of the third probabilistic axiom.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of a model failure: The adversary could exploit a service on an endpoint over the network and (sigh) use this access to double click malware that they\u0026rsquo;ve emailed to same victim. Of course, this would be a bit roundabout and would bypass our model\u0026hellip; but there may be situations that do not.\nIn these cases, we would classify it as \u0026ldquo;Other\u0026rdquo;, which is a catch-all for failures of the imagination. Some models will have a larger presence of \u0026ldquo;Other\u0026rdquo; that others due to our familiarity with risks. We still classify incidents that occur in \u0026ldquo;Other\u0026rdquo; as an area for model improvement.\nThis weakness of probabilistic models is not necessarily a bad thing if it still drives mitigation efforts in the desired way.\nIn Enterprise this aspect of scenarios-informing-scenarios is used to inform larger organizational approaches to risk.\nA principle of scenario building (see: Limitation is to assume that unknown scenarios may occur. Erring towards upward investment in a hierarchy of scenarios helps defend against \u0026quot;unknown\u0026quot; branches. The initiating events that create complex problems can sometimes not be predicted, and assuming large forms of failure can help prevent disaster.\nWe can use this flexibility to model risks and measure them. We can decompose a risk with greater resource and available effort, but not so much that we lose sight of our risks and become vulnerable to uncertainty that was not accounted for.\nOutcomes and Judgments # One issue in forecasting is deciding on the criteria that \u0026quot;closes\u0026quot; a forecast. For instance:\n Scenario : We disclose an incident to a regulator next year.  This scenario is simple to judge, as you would likely respect the judgment your legal counsel as to whether this occurred. No trouble here. Though, is important to identify how a scenario will be judged.\nThe \u0026quot;judge\u0026quot; becomes part of the forecast, and may influence the certainty of the forecasters if the judge is biased or unreliable.\nThe judges that are selected to evaluate outcomes should be considered for their impartiality to the outcome, and we want scenarios to be very specific.\nDesignate a team or individual to pass judgment on an outcome when no clear judgment exists.\nIf there is concern that a Black Swan may invalidate the forecast, it is best to make sure the forecastable outcomes include \u0026quot;other\u0026quot; circumstances. For instance:\n We disclose an incident next year. We don\u0026rsquo;t disclose an incident next year. Other  This would allow you to continue judgement under difficult to imagine circumstances. Additionally, decisions can reverse. Write defensible scenarios that mitigate flip-flopping of an outcome.\nPerhaps the regulator decides that the incident does not qualify as an incident, and there is a desire to retroactively invalidate the scenario.\nThe reliability of judgment can also be bolstered to decision makers if included in whistleblowing policy or professional codes of conduct.

Forecasts are elicted by individuals who have been calibration trained. Forecasters have a determined track record with Brier scores meeting a specific threshold. (See: Keeping Score) Historical data was sought out and modeled with frequentist approaches to inform forecasts. Measurement of \u0026quot;unknown\u0026quot; factors were a part of forecasts. A panel of individuals were relied on instead of a single individual. Critique, feedback, and whistleblowing have formal process. Outside expertise is leveraged. Monte Carlos simulations are developed and studied.  Rigor is not required for all measurements. Rather, important decisions should clearly identify what amount of rigor is expected in any measurement effort. Measurements can happen verbally at a water cooler, or with concerted effort in order to inform an important decision.\nFurther Reading # See Expert Groups, Cognitive Error, Industry\n"}).add({id:18,href:"/simple-risk-config-toml/docs/enterprise/kpi/",title:"Performance",description:"Having an available method to quantify risks may not translate well for measuring individual or organizational performance.

It is similar to the children's \u0026quot;fairness\u0026quot; concept:\n One child slices a piece of cake Another child chooses the slice they'd like.  Of course, this method prevents the first child from slicing unevenly and taking the larger piece and forces them to behave impartially to the outcome. Being partial would result in them receiving a smaller slice.\nThe ability to impartially estimate odds is crucial to forecasting and decision making. Opportunities for advantageous decision making arise when rewards are not congruent with the odds, but the ability to see these impartially can be difficult.\nPrinciple of Indifference # The principle of indifference is a rule of thumb that divides probability across all of its options. For instance, two outcomes at 50/50% or four outcomes at 25/25/25/25% respectively.\nThis principle is similar to the uniform distribution.\nWhen faced with a scenario with four outcomes, this principle suggests starting with 25% forecasted probabilities for each of outcome and continuing a study from there. Assuming there is no available information to suggest one outcome over another, this would be the most efficient default strategy to avoid error.\nDuring an elicitation, an expert may immediately disagree with these odds and find themselves confronting information about their beliefs for each scenario. Afterward, it's likely that the forecaster has opinions they may express numerically.\nThe Absurdity Test # An absurdity test would assigns extreme and irrationally formed likelihoods or values to a forecast, testing the opinions of a forecaster. For instance, \u0026quot;A small child can eat between zero and one million pies in a sitting.\u0026quot;\nWhen faced with such a test, a forecaster may be encouraged to start making a forecast less absurd. For instance \u0026quot;Well, a child can at least eat half of a pie, and maybe up to five pies, in extraordinary circumstances.\u0026quot;\nThis form of test has been used as an interview prompt in psychological research since the 1900s.\nInside and Outside Views # Tetlock\u0026rsquo;s books frequently visit the concept of inside and outside views. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume we are measuring how often we\u0026rsquo;ll suffer a major data breach.\nOutside View: How often do companies in this sector suffer major data breaches? Inside View: What makes this company different than the rest?\nThis approach to the problem allows you to consider the measurement as a prior and posterior issue. Immediately jumping to an inside view may cause you to focus on vulnerabilities and risks that are recently discussed, rather than how frequently threats may arrive to exploit them.

Since you\u0026rsquo;ve asked, we\u0026rsquo;ve identified at least 5% of engineering laptops are connecting to the bastion environment without their hostnames appearing in MDM.\n This exceeds the goalposts we set.
