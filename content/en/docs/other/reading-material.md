This document contains reading material bolstering the estimation,
expert elicitation, quantitative certainty, scenario, and forecasting
subject matters that guide Simple Risk Measurement.

## Risk Language

This section includes reading that helps navigate the problems with
\"risk\" language, miscommunications and so forth.

### Defining Risk 

The language of risk is used in a variety of ways and shows up with
different intentions in practice.

 - [Hansson, Sven Ove, “Risk”, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2018 Edition), Edward N. Zalta](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/risk/)
 - Boholm, M. , Möller, N. and Hansson, S. O. (2016), The Concepts of Risk, Safety, and Security: Applications in Everyday Language. Risk Analysis, 36: 320-338. doi:10.1111/risa.12464

### Specific Scenarios 

This section contains supporting reading for specific scenario building.
The \"Scenario\" is frequently used language in modern approaches to
risk analysis.


- [The Kaplan and Garrick Definition of Risk and its
Application to Managerial Decision Problems](https://nps.edu/documents/103424423/106950799/DRMI+Working+Paper+2011-3.pdf/bad99104-b54b-4646-9d92-45e16c2f80d8?t=1453930289000)
  - This form of the scenario is produced immediately from fault tree analyses and similar methods associated with engineering safety studies (i.e., nuclear reactor safety studies). Each scenario represents a unique concatenation of events.

 - Decision Analysis: Practice and Promise. Ronald A. Howard. Management Science, Vol. 34, No. 6. (Jun., 1988), pp. 679-695.

### Hierarchy of Scenarios

The hierarchal relationship between specific future events. This is related by the third axiom of probility, that decomposition of a scenario should have "disjoint sets" or should be mutually exclusive from one another.

 - [Fault tree analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tree_analysis#:~:text=Fault%20tree%20analysis%20(FTA)%20is,series%20of%20lower%2Dlevel%20events.&text=These%20system%20failure%20conditions%20and,in%20the%20functional%20hazard%20analysis.)

## Measurement / Approximation 

This section includes all references to, and arguments that measurements
are estimates. Generally speaking, everything we do is some form of
approximation, even when employing the use of measurement instruments.

## Expert Estimation

This section generally appeals to how experts can be queried for
quantitative data.

### Combining Expert Estimations

This describes the practice of gathering up forecast material and,
typically, averaging it together. Parimutual Betting, Simple Averages,
Weighted Scores.

### IARPA

IARPA invests in quite a bit of predictive research and publishes
results often. They are also involved in forecasting tournaments.

American Psychological Association.](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/01/intelligence-analysis.aspx)[*](https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/newsroom/iarpa-in-the-news/2015/419-teams-better-than-individuals-at-intelligence-analysis-research-finds)

### Cooke\'s \"Classical Method\"

Often found in environmental risk (Volcanic, Earthquake) and others.

## Forecasting 

### Philip Tetlock 

Tetlock\'s research revolves around how experts who are untrained in
prediction are worse than random. He has since isolated those who are
stronger forecasters (Superforecasters) and is identifying their
qualities, especially around how someone a better forecaster, and how to
further improve them with teams.

### Meteorology

Maybe the oldest area of forecasting. Understanding the industrial
development of meteorology is a great rubric for how a predictive
industry is built over time. First, the theory. Then the infrastructure.
Then the operational practice of prediction, decision making, and
learning.

## Cognitive Error 

### Kahneman / Tversky

Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky offer observations into how fallible
the human mind is in the most common of circumstances. The
classification of System 1 and System 2 thinking is highly relevant to
this area of critical thinking around risk.

 - Kahneman, D. (2015). Thinking, fast and slow.


### Meehl / Dawes

Paul E. Meehl and Robyn Dawes work in prediction inspired a full fledged
assault on the credibility of expert prediction. Comprehensive findings
that mechanical statistical models beat experts at prediction.

 - [Meehl, P. E. (1966). Clinical versus Statistical Prediction](http://meehl.umn.edu/sites/g/files/pua1696/f/155dfm1993_0.pdf)

### N. Taleb

Taleb explores the limitations of our ability to understand randomness
and the nature of randomness. Preparation for inevitable surprise, and
the emergence of Black Swans, is Taleb\'s core message.

## Intelligence Analysis 

### Sherman Kent

Sherman Kent is considered a pioneer of intelligence analysis, and
brought probabilistic rigor into the National Intelligence Estimate.

### Canadian Intelligence

There is research around Canada\'s application of modern intelligence
processing and its effectiveness. The basis of this is all
probabilistic.
