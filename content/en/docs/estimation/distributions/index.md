Nearly all of the estimation methods in this documentation so far are actually components that could be obtained from a probability distribution if one were available. You're likely familiar with the well known [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), shown below:

Other topics discussed so far are simple components of a probability distribution.

- A [percentile](/docs/estimation/percentiles) is the sum of all probabilities up to a value on a distribution.
- An [interval](/docs/estimation/interval) communicates two percentiles from a distribution. For instance, the `5%` and `95%` percentiles, and simply describing the probability of a value occurring within them. (For instance, a `90%` interval summarizes values in between `95%` and `5%`)

There are [plentiful options](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda36.htm) for studying a probability distribution elsewhere, and this documentation will focus on intuition for their use in risk measurement.

Several distributions are useful when little is known about the behavior of an unknown risk. For instance:

A **[uniform distribution](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda3662.htm)** only requires a minimum and maximum boundary, and evenly spreads outcomes across all values within.

A **[triangular distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution)** requires a minimum, a maximum, and a mode. Probability is most dense near the mode value and will not exceed the minimum or maximum.

A **[PERT distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PERT_distribution)** similarly uses a minimum, maximum, and mode. PERT is different from a triangular distribution that it includes a tail of values beyond the minimum and maximum values of a triangular distribution, and is continuous, and can be modified depending on goals.
